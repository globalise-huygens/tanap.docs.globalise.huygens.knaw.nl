# GLOBALISE Places Visualization

Initially as an intern at the GLOBALISE project and now as a student assistant, Ruben Land is working on a dataset of places that occur in the _Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren_ series of VOC documents. He uses R Shiny to create interactive visualizations of his work. These can be accessed by clicking the image below.
