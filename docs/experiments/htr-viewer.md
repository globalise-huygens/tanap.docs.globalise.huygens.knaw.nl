# GLOBALISE Transcriptions Viewer

The aim of the GLOBALISE project is to facilitate research with the 'Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren' series of documents from the VOC archives. As a first step to reaching this goal, we generate transcriptions of the c. 5 million of handwritten pages made available by the Dutch National Archives using automatic transcription software. While we publish text files of the transcriptions on the [GLOBALISE Dataverse](https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/dataverse/globalise), we also experiment with building an interface for easy searching and exploring the material. A first prototype can be accessed through the link below. Please share your feedback through the contact form on [https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/contact-us/](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/contact-us/). In the future, improved versions will be made available.

The collection of archival documents made available in the viewer comprises inventory numbers 1053-4454 and 7527-11024 from the VOC archives, National Archives, The Hague. The scans of the original documents (n=4,802,212) from the period 1610-1796 are available on the website of the National Archives: [https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/archief/1.04.02/](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/archief/1.04.02/).

Please note that the transcriptions will contain errors. They have not been manually checked for accuracy or completeness. Some labels, characterizations and information about persons, actions and events may be offensive and troubling to individuals and communities. Be careful when relying on these transcriptions and be aware of their limitations.
